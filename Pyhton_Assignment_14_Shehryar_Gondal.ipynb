    "__Q1. What is multithreading in python? Why is it used? Name the module used to handle thread in python ?__\n",
    "\n",
    "__Ans)__ Multithreading in Python refers to the ability of a program to execute multiple threads (or paths of execution) concurrently, in a single process. Each thread can perform a separate task while running simultaneously with other threads, sharing the same memory space and system resources. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Multithreading is used in Python to improve the performance of applications that need to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, without blocking the main thread. It can help to reduce the overall execution time of the program and make it more responsive, especially for long-running or CPU-intensive tasks. <br>\n",

    "__Ans)__ The threading module is used in Python to create and manage threads. It provides a high-level interface for creating and controlling threads, as well as support for synchronization, locks, and other threading primitives.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are some common functions in the threading module and their uses: <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "* __activeCount()__: This function returns the number of active threads in the current thread's context. It can be useful for debugging or monitoring thread usage in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __currentThread()__: This function returns a reference to the current thread object. It can be used to get information about the current thread, such as its name or identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __enumerate()__: This function returns a list of all active Thread objects in the current thread's context. It can be useful for monitoring or controlling thread execution, such as joining all running threads or terminating them."

    "\n",
    "__Ans)__\n",
    "* __run()__: This method is called when a thread is started by calling the start() method. It contains the code that the thread will execute, and can be overridden in a subclass to define a custom thread behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __start()__: This method is used to start a new thread and execute its run() method. It will create a new operating system thread and start the execution of the run() method in that thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __join()__: This method is used to wait for a thread to complete its execution. When called on a thread, the calling thread will block until the target thread has completed its execution. This can be useful for synchronizing thread execution or ensuring that a thread has completed its work before the program continues.\n",
    "\n",
    "* __isAlive()__: This method is used to check if a thread is currently executing. It returns a boolean value indicating whether the thread is still running or has completed its execution. This can be useful for monitoring the status of a thread and taking action based on its current state."
